# New-York-City-Taxi-Fare-Prediction

Are you planning to visit New York for the first time and wondering what would be taxi fare cost you from one place to another? This solution will give you an idea how taxi fare will be calculated in New York.

Installations Required: I have used jupter notebook for coding and python 3. You may also need to install the following libraries to run this piece of code:

NumPy (for documentation: http://www.numpy.org/)
Pandas (for documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/)
Scikit-Learn (for documentation: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Matplotlib.pyplot (for documentation: https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)
Seaborn (for documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html#installing)

The goal of this project is to predict the fare from the given latitude and longitude. Each section of the code is well documented and easy to follow. Here I have tried to explroe questions like how the pickup datetime affects the fare amount, what role the count of passengers plays in fare calculation, and how pickup day will affect the fare amount?

Files:
